# Lock Out
Android app to prevent your device from unlocking during a specified time of the day.

A simple app to lock yourself out of your phone when you need to focus on other things, but still be able to make emergency calls (and access any lock screen widgets).

Caution! Double check your times, if you set the stop time to one minute before the start time, you will lock yourself out for the whole day except that minute.
